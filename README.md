# Random scripts for terminals - all made for fun 
All ran on a manjaro machine so...

# Scripts
- `medfetch` shitty/light neofetch remake(?)

## Setup
- `nano {filename}.sh`  # Create a file to put the code or whatever into
- `chmod +x {filename}.sh`  # Give correct permissions
- `sudo mv {filename}.sh` /usr/local/bin/{name}  # Move the file

&& now just go to your terminal and run the `{name}` you put after `/bin`

# Random scripts for terminals - all made for fun 
All ran on a manjaro machine so...

## Setup
`nano {filename}.sh` create a file to put the code or whatever into
\n`chmod +x {filename}.sh` give correct permissions 
\n`sudo mv {filename}.sh /usr/local/bin/{name}` moving the file

&& now just go to your terminal and run the `{name}` you put after `/bin`

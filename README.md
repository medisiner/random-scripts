# Random scripts for terminals - all made for fun 
All ran on a manjaro machine so...

## Setup
nano {filename}.sh  # Create a file to put the code or whatever into
chmod +x {filename}.sh  # Give correct permissions
sudo mv {filename}.sh /usr/local/bin/{name}  # Move the file

&& now just go to your terminal and run the `{name}` you put after `/bin`
